# show-reusable-blocks

For some reason WordPress doesn't show you the UI for reusable blocks.

You can get to it when adding a block by scrolling down to `reusable blocks` and then clicking on `manage reusable blocks`, but that's annoying.

This plugin adds a link to the appearance menu that brings you to the list of reusable blocks.
